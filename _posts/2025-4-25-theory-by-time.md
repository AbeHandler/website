Top journals in [<u>Information</u>](https://misq.umn.edu/)
[<u>Systems</u>](https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/isre/submission-guidelines)
[<u>emphasize</u>](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2024.editorial.v35.n2)
the importance of
[<u>theory</u>](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2024.editorial.v35.n3). 
Because this construct is so central to IS, I began to
wonder, how did the discipline get here? Was it always this way?

To investigate this question, I downloaded every abstract from the
websites of MISQ, JMIS, ISR, and CAIS since the founding of each
journal. Then I used a script to check which abstracts contained at
least one occurrence of the [<u>word
stem</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem) "theor" (e.g.,
theory, theoreticalâ€¦). Using the resulting [dataset](https://gist.github.com/AbeHandler/f4dd1593190f592b894f2e7ed22c94d5), I plotted the fraction of abstracts mentioning
theory across time to get the chart shown above. (Note: it shows a 5-yr moving
average to smooth annual variation).

This admittedly coarse analysis seems to show that the emphasis on
theory within IS has grown through time. 
In the late 80s, for instance, fewer than
10% of MISQ papers mentioned "theory" in their abstracts. Today, its closer to half.
I think this is interesting
because it suggests that the discipline's focus on theory is a
relatively recent phenomenon, rather than something that has always been
central to publication in the field.

Looking at the graph I wonder ... How did it happen? Why did things evolve this way? I plan to unpack this with more blog posts down the line.
