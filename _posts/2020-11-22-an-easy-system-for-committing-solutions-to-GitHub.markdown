This semester, I found myself making a lot of solutions to problem sets and exams, which I organize in public GitHub repos. I wanted a way to store the solutions to these assignments in the repos.

After a few months I found a solution that seemed to work well. The basic idea is to created a symlinked script on my local machine which encrypts solutions files so they can be committed. 

#### Here is how it works 

{% highlight shell %}
$ ls 
secret_solutions.ipynb
$ enc secret_solutions.ipynb # encrypt the file
$ ls 
secret_solutions.ipynb secret_solutions.ipynb.enc
$ head -1 secret_solutions.ipynb.enc
ք|�m@�!�3�����3+�~�V��j:����a a;}
$ git add secret_solutions.ipynb.enc && git commit -m solutions && git push origin main  # commit solution
$ rm secret_solutions.ipynb
$ dec secret_solutions.ipynb  # decrypt the file
$ ls 
secret_solutions.ipynb, secret_solutions.ipynb.enc
{% endhighlight %}

#### How is how to set it up

Here is how to set it up. I am assuming you have have installed openssl and set up a private key at ~/.ssh/id_rsa

First download the encrypt and decrypt scripts and give them execute permissions.

{% highlight shell %}
$ wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AbeHandler/2682a90d2dc8f70ec3999bf1f54cefa2/raw/f76875941e18f90701b7da4e092526c367e97aaf/enc.sh -O $HOME/.enc.sh

$ wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AbeHandler/c12519ce198b13522628c916c9084191/raw/c00938416060a14adc7850ea9c805414d4ecc9d5/dec.sh -O $HOME/.dec.sh

$ chmod +x $HOME/.dec.sh && chmod +x $HOME/.enc.sh # give run permission
{% endhighlight %}

Then symlink the encrypt and decrypt scripts so you can access them in your PATH 

{% highlight shell %}
$ ln -s $HOME/.dec.sh ~/bin/dec.sh
$ ln -s $HOME/.enc.sh ~/bin/enc.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, alias the scripts (I did this in a .zshrc file)

{% highlight shell %}
alias enc="enc.sh"
alias dec=“dec.sh”
{% endhighlight %}

After that you should be able to run

{% highlight shell %}
$ enc file.txt # encrypts file.txt into file.txt.enc
$ dec file.txt # decrypts file.txt.enc into file.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Important note: this system relies on a private key stored on your local machine. If you lose the key (e.g. maybe you get a new laptop), you will lose the encrypted answer forever. If you are teaching a class, losing your solutions is probably not such a big deal. But I did want to make a note of this.

If you are a student and you have read to here and also find a way to hack this system, I will give you an A.
