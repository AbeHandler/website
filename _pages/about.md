I am an assistant professor with the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/business/">Leeds School of Business</a> (and <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience">Information Science</a>, by courtesy) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I earned a PhD in computer science in 2021 from the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>, where I was a member of the <a href="https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/">UMass NLP</a> group. 

As a researcher, I focus on applying NLP methods to approach both new and traditional problems in IS. Recent papers focus on application of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401224000598">large language models in decision support</a> and application of text classification to <a href="https://misq.umn.edu/ai-augmented-content-validation-in-behavioral-research-development-and-evaluation-of-the-rater-system.html">support behavioral research</a>. I am interested in human--computer interaction, causal inference, and I have a longstanding topical interest in news, media, and current events.

As a PhD student, my dissertation focused on developing new natural language processing methods for new intelligent user interfaces, with a particular emphasis on tools and methods for searching, analyzing and making sense of large bodies of text.
As a part of that work, I designed and built <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01944.pdf">systems</a> with collaborators from <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/mahyar-narges">human-computer interaction</a>, developed <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1612.pdf">algorithms</a> for efficient summarization, and researched new <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1159.pdf">natural language processing techniques</a> to support new ways of <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-5414.pdf">analyzing documents</a>. I described these earlier efforts in a 2022 <a href="/assets/pdf/ResearchStatement.pdf"><b>research statement</b></a>, which is now a little out-of-date.
