I am an assistant professor with the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/business/">Leeds School of Business</a> at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

As a researcher, I focus on applying natural language processing methods to approach both new and traditional problems in IS.
Recent papers explore the application of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401224000598">large language models in decision support</a> and the application of text classification to <a href="https://misq.umn.edu/ai-augmented-content-validation-in-behavioral-research-development-and-evaluation-of-the-rater-system.html">support behavioral research</a>. Methodologically, I am interested in design science, human--computer interaction and causal inference. I also have a longstanding topical interest in news, media, and current events.

Before joining the business school, I earned a PhD in computer science from the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>, where I was a member of the <a href="https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/">UMass Natural Language Processing</a> group. My <a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/entities/publication/170f104a-3079-4269-a08f-f31035ff5f11">dissertation</a> focused on developing new natural language processing methods for new intelligent user interfaces, with a particular emphasis on tools and methods for searching, analyzing and making sense of large bodies of text. I described these earlier efforts in a 2022 <a href="/assets/pdf/ResearchStatement.pdf">research statement</a>, which is now a little out-of-date.
